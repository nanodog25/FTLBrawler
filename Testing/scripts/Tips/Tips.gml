//You don't have to be facing towards an attack to block it
//You can't move left or right when hit, but you can jump or switch (most enemies can't)
//Your items recharge at the start of every fight, and can be used endlessly between fights
//*Hold* the 'switch' key in midair to switch twice before landing
//Attacking from an adjacent lane is slow, but enemies won't see them coming
//Switching lane halts your vertical momentum
//A slowed projectile can be punched back at the attacker. That's just good science
//Piercing shots pass through destructible objects, bullets and people
//Enemies are better at dodging friendly fire than your attacks
//If an enemy is *launched* out of the fight, they ain't coming back
//Shots that ignore cover don't cause knockback
//Starter items never become irrelevant
//As soon as you've switched, you can't be hit by anything in that lane
//Any fight can be replayed for points once you've completed a stage
//Progress is saved after each fight and you can always change your loadout - experimentation is encouraged!


//Getting around in a world that's split into 5 coloured lanes is hard, but we manage
//If you're having trouble with the perspective, try mentally filtering out anything transparent..
	//then play until you don't!
//Crossing lanes requires an implant inserted at birth. It's essentially a through-line into all
	//possible multiverses compressed into a tiny chip that registers your intent and replaces you
	//with an identical version of you but in a slightly different location.
	//No one feels it's worth mentioning these days
//Points represent either your ability to modify firearms, to act with confidence under stress, or the amount
	//of spacetime warpage you can get away with before the authorities become wise
